        First and foremost I'm a <strong>Christ-follower</strong>. But I also
        make my living in web development. I've worked primarily in React.js,
        but I'm a quick learner and will pick up anything you throw at me.

        I also enjoy basketball, golf, and drumming. I've been doing all three
        since I was a kid and will be more than happy to fill any needs you have
        in those areas as well.
